# Ad Hoc Homework Problems

Each directory in assignments contains a different homework problem, nine in total. Please complete one problem to start off, we will ask for more if your first submission passes blinded review. Make sure to read the README in each directory, it will give you important information on completing each problem.

This is an open-book test, so Google away, but please don't copy your work from pre-existing solutions you may find or ask others to help you complete the exercises. Solutions should be able to be run on a UNIX command line (Linux/Mac). We're quite familiar with Go, Ruby, Javascript, and Python, but if your submission is in some other language (which is OK), please let us know how we can set up our environment to run your code.

## Getting help

If you get stuck, have a question, or want to clarify any aspect of the
homework, use the chat button in the lower right to contact us.
Send a message, and weâ€™ll reply as soon as we can. If you submit the question outside
of our designated hours (9-5 ET), you can revisit this page later to check for a reply.

We think a sign of a good developer is one who asks questions sooner, rather
than later. We are happy to help guide you to the right solution.

## Submitting your completed homework

To submit your homework, zip up the assignment repository in a .zip file.

[recruiting site](https://people.adhoc.team/candidates/sign_up), sign up
for an account, and follow the instructions to upload your homework there!

In addition to submitting the homework, make sure to complete the application
for the job you're applying for on [our jobs page](https://www.adhocteam.us/join).

## Evaluation process

When we receive your homework, we'll assign it a random number, so that our team
does not know whose submission they are reviewing. Your homework will be
reviewed by multiple engineers on our team.

## A quick tip

A note about what we're looking for: we tend to favor solutions that clearly
and concisely solve the problem at hand. We're not looking for an
over-engineered solution. We want to see how you approach the problem,
understand what's being asked, and solve it. We tend to favor solutions that
are simple, elegant, and efficient. Submit a solution as if you were giving it
to a colleague for code review.

Good luck! We look forward to reviewing your submission.
